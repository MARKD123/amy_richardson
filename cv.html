    <h5> Background</h5>
        
     <p>I was called to the bar of England and Wales 2009 and have over 12 years advocacy experience and client management in a variety of areas, namely, childcare (both public and private), 
     high value ancillary relief, divorce, and non-molestation orders (both for applicant and respondent)<br><br>  I have worked offshore and am a qualified Guernsey Advocate in addition to
      being a member of the Bar of England and Wales. I was also a partner within a busy offshore family firm.<br><br>Due to this, I have been fortunate enough to have exposure to an extremely
       broad and high-calibre scope of work, and so can operate a varied and high-volume practice.<br><br>Since returning to the United Kingdom, I have worked in house for a Local Authority 
       within their children safeguarding department with a specialism in the conduct of cases with allegation of serious sexual abuse and neglect.<br><br>I have also undertaken CPS agency 
       work in all aspects of criminal court trials, with a focus on violent offences. In contract, I also have a specialism I the defence of historic sexual offences. 
     <br><br></be></nr>Lastly, I have experience of high end commercial and civil litigation, having the benefit of working within a fast paced offshore commercial sector. </p>
        <div>
        <div class="main">
            <h5>Expertise:</h5>
            <h5>Child Care / Family</h5>  
            <p>As stated above, I have a vast experience of all childcare matters, both public and private, and have had the advantage of having appeared for both family members and Local Authorities.</p>
            
            <p>I have appeared in many complex finding of fact hearings involving multiple allegations (often with a criminal element) in addition to initial emergency applications. <br><br>In respect of private work, I have represented parents, grandparents, and guardians in a variety of cases. <br><br>In terms of childcare and family work, I have had conduct of the cases involving the following:<br>
            <ol style="padding-left: 15%;">
            <li>Placement orders</li>
            <li>Care Orders</li>

            <li>Supervision orders</li>
            <li>Non molestation orders</li>

            <li>Allegations of sexual abuse</li>
            <li>Allegations of neglect </li>
            <li>Placement orders</li>
            </ol>  
            <h5>Ancillary Relief</h5>
            <p>As an offshore advocate, I am fortunate in that I have had the opportunity to have conduct of high end complex ancillary relief cases, often involving high net worth individuals. These cases primary involved complex financial disputes and the cross examination of forensic experts. <br><br>The matrimonial law of the Channel Islands was identical to that of the Law of England and Wales, with the relevant sections of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1972 simply transposed into Bailiwick jurisdiction. Similarly, the matrimonial case law was persuasive.<br><br>I have vast advocacy experience in terms of first appointments, financial dispute resolution hearings and final hearings.<br><br>I am also regularly instructed to provide Counsel opinion in respect of prospects of settlement. 
            <h5>Mediation</h5>   
            <p>I have assisted clients during the mediation process. This often-involved attendance and support in terms of managing a client’s expectations in order to avoid further protracted and costly litigation. 
            <h5>Criminal Law</h5>  
            <p>As stated above, I have specialised in the defence of historic sexual offences, with a particular emphasis in respect of charges of Rape and serious indecent assaults. I have also had conduct of the defence of the following:</p>    
            <ol style="padding-left: 15%;">

                <li>Wounding</li>
                <li>Grievous bodily harm</li>
                <li>Drug’s possession and importation</li>
                <li>Matters arising from proceeds of crime</li>
                </ol>  
                <p>In addition, I have also taken part in the “duty advocate” scheme, which required not only out of hours police station attendance but also the representation of disposal of individuals at Court.</p>
                <h5>Civil Litigation</h5>
                <p>I have had conduct of several civil litigation matters with a range of complexity, namely:
                    <ol style="padding-left: 15%;">
                        <li>Evictions and stays of evictions</li>

                        <li>Debt recovery</li>
                        </ol>  
                        <h5>Medical Negligence / Personal Injury</h5>
                <p>Offshore, I have acted for both the MDDUS and MDU being involved in both mediations and complex medical negligence hearings. Notably, I have also been instructed for to represent those in respect of matters before the GMC.</p>
                <p>I have had conduct of several civil litigation matters with a range of complexity, namely:
                    <h5>Contentious Probate</h5>
                    <ol style="padding-left: 15%;">
                        <li>Removal of executor</li>
                        <li>Issues of validity and competency</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h5> “PLEVIN Litigation / Fast Track / Small Claims</h5>
                        <p> I have undertaken a high volume of Plevin cases, and have appeared in terms of:</p>
                        <ol style="padding-left: 15%; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>Fast Track Trials</li>
                            <li>Small Claims Track Trials</li>
                            <li>Dispute Resolution hearings</li>
                            <li>Relief from Sanction applications</li>
                            <li>Costs</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>I have also been involved in the drafting of skeleton arguments (dealing with the usual issues of limitation, unfairness, compromise, and redress), and as such am familiar with past and current case law. I have also provided opinions as to:</p>
                            <ol style="padding-left: 15%; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                <li>Legal issues of unfairness, compromise etc</li>
                                <li>Application and implication of recent decisions (for example the principles of the Court of Appeal Judgment in “Potter”)</li>
                                <li>Subject Access requests</li>
                                <li>Disclosure obligations in civil proceedings</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Essentially, I have vast experience within the field of “Plevin” litigation, and would welcome the opportunity for further instruction </p>

                        <h5>Medical Negligence / Personal Injury</h5>
                <p>Offshore, I have acted for both the MDDUS and MDU being involved in both mediations and complex medical negligence hearings. Notably, I have also been instructed for to represent those in respect of matters before the GMC.</p>
                <p>I have had conduct of several civil litigation matters with a range of complexity, namely:
                    <h5>Contentious Probate</h5>
                    <ol style="padding-left: 15%;">
                        <li>Removal of executor</li>
                        <li>Issues of validity and competency</li>
                        </ol>  
                        <p>Amy has had conduct of several high value contentious probate matters. She has been involved the following:</p>
                        <h5> “PLEVIN Litigation / Fast Track / Small Claims</h5>
                        <p> I have undertaken a high volume of Plevin cases, and have appeared in terms of:</p>
                        <ol style="padding-left: 15%; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>Fast Track Trials</li>
                            <li>Small Claims Track Trials</li>
                            <li>Dispute Resolution hearings</li>
                            <li>Relief from Sanction applications</li>
                            <li>Costs</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>I have also been involved in the drafting of skeleton arguments (dealing with the usual issues of limitation, unfairness, compromise, and redress), and as such am familiar with past and current case law. I have also provided opinions as to:</p>
                            <ol style="padding-left: 15%; list-style-type: lower-roman;">

                                <li>Application and implication of recent decisions (for example the principles of the Court of Appeal Judgment in “Potter”)</li>
                                <li>Subject Access requests</li>
                                <li>Disclosure obligations in civil proceedings</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Essentially, I have vast experience within the field of “Plevin” litigation, and would welcome the opportunity for further instruction </p>
